## Troubleshooting

### Errors
- `-2147220409` error code is related to iis app pool identity permissions
- `Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID {BAE80C14-D2AC-11D0-8384-00A0C92018F4} failed due to the following error: 80040154 Class not registered (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80040154 (REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG)).` This error code is when the app fails to find the edocs library, this if often due to "enable 32 bit application" being to set to false on the app pool, please set to true if only 32bit edocs is installed.
